# TickTacToe-game



1. Create the game board: You can represent the game board as a 3x3 array or a 2D grid.

2. Implement the checkWin() method: This method will check if a player has achieved a winning condition. You'll need to check all possible winning combinations, such as rows, columns, and diagonals.

3. Implement the reset() method: This method will reset the game when a player wins or the game ends in a draw. You'll need to clear the game board and reset any game-related variables.

4. Implement the draw() method: This method will check if the game ends in a draw. You'll need to check if all positions on the game board are filled and no player has won.

5. Write unit tests: Write unit tests for all three methods, including all possible winning conditions. Use assertions to check if the methods are working correctly.
